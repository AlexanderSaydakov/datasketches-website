* [Duties of the PMC Chair](http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#chair)

## Initial Checks
* [Review the project Status](https://incubator.apache.org/projects/datasketches.html) : DONE
* [Review the Clutch Report](http://incubator.apache.org/clutch/datasketches.html): DONE

## Define a Charter - Done
* Apache DataSketches consists of software related to
    an open source, high-performance library of stochastic
    streaming algorithms commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences.
    Sketches are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a
    stream and can provide approximate answers, with mathematical
    guarantees, to computationally difficult queries orders-of-magnitude
    faster than traditional, exact methods.

## Demonstrate Community Readiness - Open for Feedback
* Recruit users, developers, committers and PMCers
	* We have participated in a number of conferences
		* USPTO-2020 Tech Conference
		* Spark & AI 2020 Conference
		* ACM-KDD Conference
		* ApacheCon 2019 and 2020
		* FOSDEM 2020 Conference (Brussels)
		* See [Presentations](https://datasketches.apache.org/docs/Background/Presentations.html).
	* DataSketches is integrated into a number of systems, for example:
	   * Apache Druid
	   * Apache Impala (in process)
	   * Permutive.com
	   * GCHQ/Gaffer
	   * Splice Machine
	   * PostgreSQL
	   * Apache Hive
	   * Apache Pig
	   * Nielsen.com
	   * Amazon AWS (in process)
	* We recently added a new committer on August 17, 2020.
* Take responsible collective action
	* We do post major issues for disscussion and vote on our dev@ mailing list. 
* Demonstrate ability to disagree in public on technical matters without destroying personal relationships
	* We are all professionals and individuals with different points of view. Our ability to deal with diversity is what makes us strong.
* Create an open, positive and inclusive atmosphere on the mailing lists
	* We have received very positive feedback from our users about our responsiveness, willingness to help, and openness to invite new users into our discussions. 

## Complete Project Maturity Model - Open for Feedback
